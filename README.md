# finalCapstone

This file provides an overview of some of the completed projects during my studies at HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, with a brief description of each folder:

- Project 1 (finance_calculators.py) involves basic math skills and showcases general Python programming knowledge, allowing users to choose between investment 
and loan mortgage calculations.

- Project 2 (holiday.py) requires advanced Python programming and data wrangling skills. It simulates a system for calculating the cost of a holiday, including 
airfare, lodging, and car rentals based on various inputs and circumstances.

- Project 3 (capstone project) is related to Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), with two PDF documents. The first describes three NLP types, while the second is 
a research paper exploring NLP techniques used by companies with real-world examples.
