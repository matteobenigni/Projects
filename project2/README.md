# Summary

This code is a partial system for a small travel agency, limited by unusual circumstances and lack of time to collect all relevant data. To overcome some of these limitations, I used a list of UK airports and created dictionaries to help with data collection. The program includes variables, functions, and comments to help understand the code.

# Table of contents

## Creating dictionaries and variables

1.1. Dictionary for city codes and airport destinations

1.2. List of available cities and valid inputs

1.3. Variables for user input and confirmation

## Reading and cleaning data from CSV file

2.1. Reading the CSV file using pandas

2.2. Cleaning up column names and resetting index

2.3. Prompting user for input and validating selection

## Flight options and user input

3.1. Initializing variables and creating a dictionary for flight options

3.2. Looping to get user's choice of daytime or nighttime flights

3.2.1. Prompting user for choice and validating input

3.2.2. Looping to get user's choice of preferred time

3.2.2.1. Printing available options and prompting user for input

3.2.2.2. Confirming selection and exiting loop

3.3. Looping to get user's choice of car rental options

3.3.1. Prompting user for input and validating selection

3.3.2. Nested loops to handle errors and prompt for valid input

3.4. Prompting user for hotel rating and confirmation

## Putting it all together

4.1. Printing summary of user's selections

4.2. Calculating and printing total cost of trip
